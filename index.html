                            <p>Became a member of Labitat today. Actually, I started the day by making a lightweight roadmap for my learning of web programming and technology. And after work I went to Labitat to enlist as a member. Labitat is a makerspace, a basement full of tools and components. Usually there are also other people there working on their projects or speaking together. This evening I continued my work on the favorites page. I corrected a for each loop, since it is not supported by internet explorer. The I moved on to my plan about implementing a favorites feature that counts how many times a link has been used and also saves the timestamp of the last use of the link. I use localstorage for saving the information, so it will depend on the machine and browser you are using. As it is now you can’t access your favorites from another pc. But that is next step. Gradually increasing functionality and learning new stuff. Again, good sources of information is <a  href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3schools</a>. Below my roadmap…</p>

                            <p>This week I started second phase of my journey into web programming. Some minor adjustments has been made to the css. This week’s biggest update is on the <a href="favorites.html">favorites</a> page; some more links and a category filter has been added. It is coded in vanilla JavaScript with a lot of help from <a href="http://w3schools.com">w3schools</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow</a>. I also learned better ways to build the JavaScript code using <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>. I tried starting in NetBeans but it quickly got frustrating and in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow</a> I used the links to <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> examples and I started copying css and html from NetBeans to <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>. Then I worked with the JavaScript code until it did what I wanted. Take a look at the favorites page. I hope you like it. To summarize my plan: start with a static css + html then keep expanding the html and gradually add JavaScript for improved gui response. Third phase will be to add a backend, I don’t know what it is going to be. PHP is rather popular but there are many other options so I will do some research before I jump into that.</p>

                            <p>My programming skills are old-school. I started with assembler on my C128. That gave me a good foundation to build on. Not only being able to keep overview of a large complex program, but also debugging techniques and considerations about speed and memory. Through the years of education and work I also learned Pascal, C, C++, Java and C#. Many more languages exist today and I have briefly played with some of them. 15 years ago, I build a web application for capacity management in telecom. I already knew Java so I chose Tomcat as my webserver. I didn't use any PHP or JavaScript. Only Java and HTML. When Android came, I jumped on that platform because it was Java. But mid 2016 I started looking into today's languages and tools for web development; HTML 5.0, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. In this page, I will collect all the links that has inspired me.</p>

                            <p>I recently got a new laptop – Yoga 910 with Windows 10, this has to some degree changed the way I work. I mainly focus on web development and I choose NetBeans. I know NetBeans from my Java days, but before making the final decision I did look into other options<br>
                                <b>Notepad++</b>. Very nice and simplified editor with a lot of available plugins for improved productivity. I really liked the ftp plugin that automatically syncs with your web site when saving.<br>
                                <b>MS Visual Studio</b>. Installs a lot of stuff that I didn’t need or ask for.<br>
                                <b>MS Visual Code</b>. Simple and with an option of a large amount of extensions. I experienced some performance issues with very slow response from the editior.<br>
                                <b>WebStorm</b>. Very nice with a lot of features, but not free.<br>
                                I still want to try Sublime text.</p>

                            <p>So, I took a look at some of the available option for task- and project management. In my past I have used Excel a lot to keep track on information. Outlook was my database. Information was shared via Email. This time I started up by using my old habits but after having adjusted my excel sheet a couple of times I thought “There must be an easier way”. I googled and found add-ins for excel, access, WordPress, SharePoint and a lot of online services among those Trello, Evernote and Wunderlist. OneNote also popped up. But I started by creating a Trello account and it seemed easy to use. I googled some best practices for project management on Trello and found a blog with a lot of information. I create a card for each delivery I have. In the description field, I keep all information I want to be able to view quickly, I use the markdown for making links to files on SharePoint or other web system that I use. Below the description field I keep a checklist with all the tasks I have to accomplish to complete the delivery to the costumer and doing all reporting and documentation. But there was one problem. I work with restricted information and it is not allowed to exists on cloud based services outside company domain. So I went to OneNote and have migrated all my key information to my OneNote workbook. I can link my tasks to outlook with a due date and there is a link back to the workbook form the outlook task. OneNote support hyperlinks to files on local computers and on shared network. If the workbook on the company SharePoint I can share it with others as read/write or read-only. Files can be attached, mails can be send from outlook to a page, you can tag information with custom tags which can be searched and filtered. I have decided that my OneNote workbook should be my only database in the future, so all mails containing important information or needs follow up are put on the relevant project page. And because of the build in OCR everything is searchable.</p>
